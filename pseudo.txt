Turn input into Scenario object
Scenario object has the list of numbers, the target value, and the mode for the order of operations
pretty sure this is an NP hard problem so the only way to determine a correct solution is to iterate all permutations

main {
    Go through all inputs and turn them into Scenarios
    for each Scenario {
        for each possible ordering of the numbers {
            for each space between numbers, add a +
            replace a + with a *
            switch the position of the * until its been in all positions
            add another * and repeat
            for each permutation, record the solution
        }
    }
}




for normal OOO:
vector of numbers, vector of operators
for each operator {
    if it is a * {
        compute the product of the adjacent numbers
        replace one numerand with the product and erase the other numerand
        erase the operator from the vector
        start from the beginning of the arrays to avoid skipping 
    }
    if you reach the end of the array, break
}
compute the sums left to right because they are all +'s
