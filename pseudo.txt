Turn input into Scenario object
Scenario object has the list of numbers, the target value, and the mode for the order of operations
pretty sure this is an NP hard problem so the only way to determine a correct solution is to iterate all permutations

main {
    Go through all inputs and turn them into Scenarios
    for each Scenario {
        for each possible ordering of the numbers {
            for each space between numbers, add a +
            replace a + with a *
            switch the position of the * until its been in all positions
            add another * and repeat
            for each permutation, record the solution
        }
    }
}
